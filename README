#Sales Performance Analysis (Excel)

##Project Overview

This project analyzes sales performance for a Superstore retail business
to understand what drives revenue growth and where sales efficiency
breaks down using historical sales data. While the business shows consistent year-over-year sales growth, profit trends indicate that not all sales contribute equally to sustainable revenue.

An interactive Excel dashboard was built to analyze sales trends,
discount dependency, and loss-making orders. Scenario-based analysis was
then used to recommend ways to improve revenue quality without reducing
sales volume.

##Business Problem

The business is growing its sales year over year, but profitability
fluctuates due to heavy reliance on discounting. The business needs to understand overall sales performance and identify the factors contributing to unstable profitability. The key challenge is to
identify:

- Which discount levels genuinely support sales growth.
- Evaluate the impact of discounts and shipping decisions on sales
  outcomes.
- Identify loss-making sales practices and estimate potential revenue
  recovery.

##Data Cleaning & Preparation

Data cleaning and preparation were carried out using Power Query and Excel.

I began by removing duplicate records to ensure each order was counted only once. Since missing values accounted for less than 1% of the dataset, I removed null values to avoid introducing unnecessary assumptions. I then reviewed the data for inconsistencies, such as irregular entries in categorical fields, and corrected them where required. Date fields were also standardised to ensure consistency for time-based analysis.

Once the data was clean, I created additional analytical columns in Excel. Discount bands were defined using an IFS formula and grouped into:

No Discount: 0%
Low discount: 10%
Medium discount: 11–29%
High discount: Above 30%

A separate column was created to flag loss-making orders, which helped isolate inefficient sales.

##Key Findings

- Sales show consistent year-over-year growth, indicating strong
  demand.
- Technology is the highest revenue-generating category and a key
  driver of sales.
- Over 50% of orders rely on discounts, making discounting central to
  sales performance.
- Low (<=10%) and medium (11-29%) discounts successfully drive sales
  while remaining largely profitable.
- High discounts (>=30%) do not proportionally increase sales and
  frequently result in loss-making orders.
- Profit percentage fluctuates despite increasing sales.
- Certain shipping methods combined with high discounts significantly
  amplify losses.
- The Central region in 2017 shows a concentration of inefficient,
  loss-making sales.

##Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, Slicers)
- Power Query (data cleaning and transformation)
- What-If & Scenario Analysis
- Trend analysis and basic forecasting

##Potential Business Impact

Scenario-based What-If analysis suggests that a combined approach of:

- Capping high-risk discounts, and
- Restricting premium shipping only for higher Average Order Value
  (AOV) orders or high discount orders
 could potentially recover around 10% of revenue currently lost due to
 inefficient discounting and shipping decisions.
